# V-Gate Disco

3D printable artwork that resembles a perpetual
motion magnetic motor which I haven't (yet) tried
to build.

Apart from energy conservation law, I don't see why 
shouldn't it work. Also I can't prove that it will work. 

Building this machine is not expensive so it might be good
as educational project to see what happens.

It is supposed to create rotating endless V-gate
structure which will create constant force to a nearby
magnet, hopfully counter-balanced with constant torque
to the discs.

From aspect of energy conservation law, something like this
should not work.
