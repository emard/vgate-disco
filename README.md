# V-Gate Disco

3D printable artwork that resembles a perpetual
motion magnetic motor which I haven't (yet) tried
to build.

Regarding the energy conservation law, it should not
work. Apart from that, I don't see why shouldn't it work.

It is supposed to create rotating endless V-gate
structure which creates force to a stator
magnet, hopfully counter-balanced with torque
on the rotor discs.

Building this machine is not expensive as simple
educational project to see what happens.
